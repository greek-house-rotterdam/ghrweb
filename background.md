# Task Background

Build the website for the organization "Greek House in Rotterdam" (GHR).

Goal: Building a website to solve the organization's current issues and help raise awareness about the organisation's presence, actions, vonlunteering, community, etc.

We want to avoid "Feature Creep" while ensuring the site doesn't become a digital ghost town six months after launch.

We aim for the optimal combination of value, complexity, reliability, ease-of-use (for both visitors & admins, etc). Simplicity is perfection.

Primary Vision: A sustainable, low-maintenance hub for cultural history, community news, and event coordination.

Key Objectives:

Accessibility: Bilingual (GR/NL) from launch.

Simplicity: Managed by non-technical members of the cultural group.

Sustainability: Minimal annual costs and high security.
