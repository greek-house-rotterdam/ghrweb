# Project Context

Building the website for "Greek House in Rotterdam" (GHR) — a sustainable, low-maintenance hub for cultural history, community news, and event coordination.

## Guiding Principles

- Avoid feature creep; simplicity is perfection
- Optimize for value, reliability, and ease-of-use (visitors & admins)
- The site must not become a digital ghost town — keep it maintainable

## Key Objectives

- **Accessibility:** Trilingual (GR/NL/EN) from launch
- **Simplicity:** Managed by non-technical members of the cultural group
- **Sustainability:** Minimal annual costs and high security

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Astro (static site generator) + Tailwind CSS
- **CMS:** Decap CMS (Git-based, admin UI at `/admin`)
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages (free tier, auto-deploy from GitHub)
- **Translation:** GitHub Action + DeepL API for content; JSON files for UI strings
- **Forms:** Embedded Google Forms
- **Content:** Markdown files in `src/content/` organized by language (`gr/`, `nl/`, `en/`)

## Developer Profile

- Senior backend developer, expert in Python and AI engineering
- Intermediate in GCP deployments, Firebase Cloud Functions/CLI, and GitHub Actions
- Beginner-level frontend — relies heavily on AI coding assistants
- Prefer code-first approaches with clear, simple patterns over complex frontend frameworks
