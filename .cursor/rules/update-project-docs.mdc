# Update Project Documents

When making changes that affect project scope, requirements, decisions, or context, update the relevant documents:

- `docs/background.md` — project goals, constraints, and high-level context
- `docs/pre_interview_prd.md` — PRD before stakeholder interviews
- `docs/post_interview_prd.md` — detailed requirements from stakeholder interviews

## When to update

- A new feature or requirement is introduced or removed
- A design/architecture decision is made that changes scope
- Stakeholder feedback changes priorities or constraints
- A question from the PRD is answered or resolved

## How to update

- Be **clear** — use plain language, avoid jargon
- Be **simple** — one idea per bullet or paragraph
- Be **concise** — no filler, every sentence earns its place
- Be **articulate** — precise wording, no ambiguity
- Be **comprehensive** — capture the full picture without omitting relevant details
